# Assignment 7: Basics of Scheduling
## Objective
The goal of this week's assignment is to make you familiar with basic terms and questions concerning scheduling.

## Required Tasks
Answer the following questions

1. **Scheduling -- Process Selection**
If a process A is waiting for something it starts blocking: If another process (let's call it B) has to finish to let A finish the task, it wouldn't be bad if we execute B before any other process with a lower priority.

2. **Minimizing Turn Around Time**
Reordered process list:

| Process |A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Expected run time (msec) | 2 | 5 | 8 | 12 | 16 | 21 | 34 | 55
---

Minimal average time: 19,125 ms
Turn-around time: 409
